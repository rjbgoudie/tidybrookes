\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame}

\item{y}{A data frame}

\item{join_by}{A character vector of variables to join \code{x} and \code{y} by}

\item{filter_by}{A character vector indicating the grouping to use when
filtering}

\item{filter_condition}{An expression that indicates whether the
corresponding row should be included}

\item{names_from, values_from}{A pair of arguments describing which column
(or columns) to get the name of the output column (\code{names_from}), and which
column (or columns) to get the cell values from (\code{values_from}).}

\item{names_suffix}{A character string for naming the summary output}
}
\value{
A data frame
Where \code{type} is \code{"none"} all matched rows in \code{y}.
Where \code{type} is \verb{"slice}, rows satifying the \code{formula} under \code{slice} are
returned
Where \code{type} is \code{"summarise"}, a new \code{summary} column is returned
